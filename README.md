## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ke Jun from Singapore, I mainly code automation scripts, data analysis and full stack apps. I like using python (lol basic) but I'm willing and open to learning other languages as well. I enjoy coding cool things, finding cool insights from data, and am also interested in getting into AI and Machine learning
